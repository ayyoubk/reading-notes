# Forms and JS Events

## HTML Chapter 7: “Forms”

**What ?**

*HTML Form refer to different elements that allow you to collect information from visitors to your site.*

**Why ?**

*Forms enabling users to search, you will see forms when registering as a member of a website, when shopping online, and when signing up for newsletters or mailing lists*

**How ?**

*Form controls live inside a `<form>` element. And every `<form>` element requires an `action` attribute. Its value is the URL for the page on the server that will receive the information in the form when it is submitted.*

*`method` Forms can be sent using one of two methods: `get` or `post`.*

*There are several types of form controls :*

- ADDING TEXT
- Making Choices
- Submitting Forms
- Uploading Files

*The `<input>` element is used to create several different form controls. `type="text"` it creates a singleline text input. each form control requires a `name` attribute becuse the server needs to know which form control each piece of data was entered into. You can use the `maxlength` attribute to limit the number of characters a user may enter into the text field.*

*`type="password"` creates a text box that acts just like a single-line text input, except the characters are blocked out.*

*The `<textarea>` element is used to create a mutli-line text input.*

*The `<select>` element is used to create a drop down list box. It contains two or more `<option>` elements.*

*The `<button>` element was introduced to allow users more control*

*You can group related form controls together inside the `<fieldset>` element. The `<legend>` element can come directly after the opening `<fieldset>` tag and contains a caption which helps identify the purpose of that group of form controls.*


## HTML Chapter 14: “Lists, Tables & Forms”

**Bullet Point Styles**

*The `list-style-type` property allows you to control the shape or style of a bullet point.*

*For an unordered list you can use the following values:*
- none

- circle
- square

*For an ordered (numbered) list you can use the following values:*
- decimal 1 2 3
- decimal-leading-zero 01 02 03
- lower-alpha a b c
- upper-alpha A B C
- lower-roman i. ii. iii.
- upper-roman I II III

*Or you can specify an image to act as a bullet point using the `list-style-image` property.*

*Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent.*


## JS Chapter 6: “Events”


> **An event is nothing more than a signal. It communicates that something has just happened. An event defines the thing that happens. It fires the signal. The second part of the model is defined by the reaction to the event. [kirupa](https://www.kirupa.com/about/whatiskirupa.htm)**
