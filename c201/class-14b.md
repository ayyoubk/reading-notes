# What Google Learned About Teams

***Reading today was a long and wonderful story, I learned the following:***

- the bulk of modern work is more and more team-based, at many companies, more than three-quarters of an employee’s day is spent communicating with colleagues.
- In the last decade, the tech giant has spent untold millions of dollars measuring nearly every aspect of its employees’ lives. 
- there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference

- Communication is another vital characteristic for effective teamwork. Members must be able to effectively communicate with each other to overcome obstacles, resolve conflict, and avoid confusion. Communication increases cohesion.

- Communication is important within teams to clearly define the teams purpose so that there is a common goal. Having a common goal will increase cohesion because all members are striving for the same objective and will help each other achieve their goal.

- Commitment is another important characteristic for teams. It occurs when members are focused on achieving the team's common goal.

- High levels of interdependence to maintain high levels of trust, risk-taking, and performance.

- Teams are more effective when everyone is friends away from work
