# Introductory HTML and JavaScript
## HTML Chapter 1: “Structure”
*HTML describes the structure of the pages by tags. Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.*

***Attributes** provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.*
> HTML5 allows you to use uppercase attribute names and omit the quotemarks, but this is not recommended.


*`<head>` This contains information about the page. You will usually find a `<title>` element inside the `<head>` element.*

*`<body>`Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window.*

## HTML Chapter 8: “Extra Markup” 

*DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.*

*If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these characters: `<!-- comment goes here -->`*

*The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.*

*The `<div>` and `<span>` elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.*

*`<iframes>` cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.*

## HTML Chapter 17: “HTML5 Layout”

>The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.

## HTML Chapter 18: “Process & Design”

*Every website should be designed for the target audience,So you should know who the target audience is,Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming.*

*First you want to create a list of reasons why people would be coming to your site. You can then assign the list of tasks to the fictional visitors you created in the step described on the previous page.*

*Now that you know what needs to appear on your site, you can start to organize the information into Site Map.*

**Site Map**

**Wireframe** *is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.*

*The primary aim of any kind of visual design is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing information on a page helps users understand its importance and what order to read it in.*


**Designing Navigation** *site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also helps them understand what your site is about and how it is organized.*

## JS Chapter 1: “The ABC of Programming”

*A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.*

>Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans , so your instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically.

>To approach writing a script , break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task ( a flowchart can help ) .
