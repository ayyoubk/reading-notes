# NODE.JS

1- ***What Is Node.js?***

Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library. Node Is Built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine

2- ***In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?***

The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

3- ***What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?***

Javascript runtime refers to where your javascript code is executed when you run it

4- ***What is npm?***

npm is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform.

5- ***What version of node are you running on your machine?***

6- ***What version of npm are you running on your machine?***

7.15.1

7- ***What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?***

`npm install jshint` 


8- ***What Is Node.js Used For?***

Now that we know what Node and npm are and how to install them, we can turn our attention to the first of their common uses: installing (via npm) and running (via Node) various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.

These build tools come in all shapes and sizes, and you won’t get far in a modern JavaScript landscape without bumping into them. They can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.


## Pair Programing

1- ***Six Reasons for Pair Programming***

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

2- ***In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?***

Learn from others and develop communication skills

3- ***How does pair programming work?***

While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code.
