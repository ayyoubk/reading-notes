## Consider the history: [That Time When Women Stopped Coding](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding)

1. What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?

    - personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.

1. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

    - I think because they were qualified to work on it with high efficiency and to have the ability to solve computer-related problems.

## Review the data: [Employee breakdown of key technology companies](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/)

1. What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?

    - The proportion of males is greater in companies
    - Asians are the largest percentage in most companies
    - Hardware manufacturing companies have fewer female workers. 

## Ask the question: [Why diversity matters to your tech company](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2015/07/21/why-diversity-matters-your-tech-company/30419871/)

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?

    - when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters.

1. Why do diverse companies perform better?

    - because diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones, so spite of homogeneity is not a counterpoint to the overwhelming evidence that diversity makes teams smarter and is linked to positive business outcomes.

1. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa?

    - "that's When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups and When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result. This factor may be especially relevant for leaders of consumer tech companies."
