# Introduction to React and Components

## Component Based Architecture

***A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.***

*Characteristics of Components :*
- Reusability
- Replaceable 
- Not context specific
- Extensible 
- Encapsulated 
- Independent 

*Advantages :*
- Ease of deployment
- Reduced cost
- Ease of development
- Reusable 
- Modification of technical complexity
- Reliability 
- System maintenance and evolution
- Independent

## What is Props and How to Use it in React ?

***React is a component-based library which divides the UI into little reusable pieces. In some cases, those components need to communicate (send data to each other) and the way to pass data between components is by using props.***

***“Props”** is a special keyword in React , which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.*

*data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child)*

*Using Props in React*

1. Define an attribute and its value(data)
2. Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props
3. Render the Props Data
