# **Operators and Loops**
## **Comparison and logical operators**
#### ***You can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be. The result will be a Boolean: true or false.***
- == is equal to (datatype NOT consider)
- != is not equal to (datatype NOT consider)
- === strict equal to (datatype & value consider)
- !== not strict equal to (datatype & value consider)
- (>) Greater Than
- (<) Less Than
- (>=) Greater Than OR equal to
- (<=) Less Than OR equal to

#### ***In any condition, there is usually one operator and two operands. The operands are placed on each side of the operator. They can be values or variables. You often see expressions enclosed in brackets.***
#### ***Comparison operators usually retum single values of true or false. Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.***
- && Logical AND
- | | Logical OR
- ! Logical NOT
#### ***SHORT-CIRCUIT EVALUATION***
#### ***Logical expressions are evaluated left to right. If the first condition can provide enough information to get the answer, then there is no need to evaluate the second condition.***

## **for and while loops**
#### ***Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns false. There are three common types of loops:***
- FOR
- WHILE
- DO WHILE
#### ***FOR, If you need to run code a specific number of times, use a for loop. (It is the most common loop.) In a for loop, the condition is usually a counter which is used to tell how many times the loop should run.***
#### ***WHILE, If you do not know how many times the code should run, you can use a while loop. Here the condition can be something other than a counter, and the code will continue to loop for as long as the condition is true.***
#### ***DO WHILE, The do while loop is very similar to the while loop, but has one key difference: it will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once, even if the condition evaluates to false.***
