# **CSS Color**
### ***The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:***
- RGB Values (These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90))
- Hex Codes (These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80)
- Color Names (There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: DarkCyan)

#### ***Opacity :CSS3 introduces the opacity property which allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements.The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0***

### **HSL Colors**
#### ***CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive way to specify colors using hue, saturation, and lightness values.***
1. Hue is the colloquial idea of color. In HSL colors, hue is often represented as a color circle where the angle represents the color, although it may also be shown as a slider with values from 0 to 360.

2. Saturation is the amount of gray in a color. Saturation is represented as a percentage. 100% is full saturation and 0% is a shade of gray.

3. Lightness is the amount of white (lightness) or black (darkness) in a color. Lightness is represented as a percentage. 0% lightness is black, 100% lightness is white, and 50% lightness is normal. Lightness is sometimes referred to as luminosity.
